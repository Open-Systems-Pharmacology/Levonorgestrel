# Levonorgestrel
Whole-body PBPK model of Levonorgestrel as well as ethinyl estradiol 


This repository contains:


- a PK-Sim project (*.pksim5) file of the current PBPK model(s)



This levonogrestrel model is intended to be used as victim drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI) when orally administered either alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol in healthy and obese women. 

The model incorporates dynamic changes in SHBG protein-binding, via an Emax model, observed during long-term use of levonogrestrel and ethinyl estradiol. 

The presented model represents an original model development project presented by Cicali *et al.* [1]. A complete summary of model development and application can be found in this manuscript and respective supplemental materials.
